We deﬁne an architecture, called the blockclique, that addresses this limitation by sharding transactions in a block graph with multiple threads. A block in a given thread only contains transactions with input addresses assigned to this thread, and references one previous block of each thread as parents. When combined with a Proof-of-Stake node selection mechanism, the blockclique architecture reaches 10,000 transactions per second with a transaction time of less than a minute in our simulations, while being robust against known and projected attacks.}, note={arXiv: 1803.09029}, journal={arXiv:1803.09029 [cs]}, author={Forestier, Sébastien and Vodenicarevic, Damir and Laversanne-Finot, Adrien}, year={2019}, month={Sep} }
