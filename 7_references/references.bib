The problem is to time-stamp the data, not the medium. We propose computationally practical procedures for digital time-stamping of such documents so that it is infeasible for a user either to back-date or to forward-date his document, even with the collusion of a time-stamping service. Our procedures maintain complete privacy of the documents themselves, and require no record-keeping by the time-stamping service.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Cryptology}, author={Haber, Stuart and Stornetta, W.

 @article{Nakamoto, title={Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System}, abstractNote={A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they’ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.}, author={Nakamoto, Satoshi}, pages={9} }

 contract platforms is the amount of time and computational power required to reach consensus. In a
 classical blockchain model, each operation is in fact performed by each node, both to update the
 status and to validate the results of the calculations performed by others. In this short survey we
 sketch some state-of-the-art approaches to obtain an eﬃcient and scalable computation of smart
 contracts. Particular emphasis is given to sharding, a promising method that allows parallelization
 and therefore a more eﬃcient management of the computational resources of the network.},

Although the security provisions of Bitcoin have been thoroughly analysed, the security guarantees of variant (forked) PoW blockchains (which were instantiated with different parameters) have not received much attention in the literature. This opens the question whether existing security analysis of Bitcoin’s PoW applies to other implementations which have been instantiated with different consensus and/or network parameters. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative framework to analyse the security and performance implications of various consensus and network parameters of PoW blockchains. Based on our framework, we devise optimal adversarial strategies for double-spending and selfish mining while taking into account real world constraints such as network propagation, different block sizes, block generation intervals, information propagation mechanism, and the impact of eclipse attacks. Our framework therefore allows us to capture existing PoW-based deployments as well as PoW blockchain variants that are instantiated with different parameters, and to objectively compare the tradeoffs between their performance and security provisions.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={Gervais, Arthur and Karame, Ghassan O. and Wüst, Karl and Glykantzis, Vasileios and Ritzdorf, Hubert and Capkun, Srdjan}, year={2016}, month={Oct}, pages={3–16}, collection={CCS ’16} }

@article{will_blockchain_be_big_deal, title={Will Blockchain Be a Big Deal? Reasons for Caution}, volume={31}, ISSN={1745-6622}, DOI={10.1111/jacf.12379}, abstractNote={The initial enthusiasm for implementing blockchain in financial markets has been dampened considerably by its collision with economic realities. Though the author warns against avoiding the Panglossian trap of viewing ours as the best of all possible worlds, he reminds us that trusted institutions have evolved and emerged in a competitive environment as a means of economizing on transaction costs. Such costs arise from the nature of transactions, including crucially the information environment in which they take place. Though new technologies such as blockchain have the potential to reduce some of these costs, they often do so without fundamentally changing the underlying economic conditions that give rise to them. And as a result, institutions such as banks and exchanges that technologists scoff at may well prove surprisingly competitive and durable in the face of technological challengers. The most successful implementation of blockchain—Bitcoin—solves a very basic transactional challenge peculiar to cryptocurrency: the double spend problem. But it does so in a very expensive way, and many other transactions pose far more complex challenges. The three cautionary tales provided by the author—the first involving securities and derivatives trading and clearing, the second commodity trading, and the third proposals to “equitize” assets—all demonstrate the need to confront “Chesterton’s Fence” when evaluating the potential of blockchain in any particular application. In other words, to understand the value of a new technology for a given set of functions, one must understand the economic forces that have shaped the processes and institutions that currently perform those functions. When such forces are considered, it often becomes apparent that new technologies like blockchain will not prove superior to existing practices—and may even create adverse unintended consequences that offset and perhaps even eliminate its beneficial effects.}, number={4}, journal={Journal of Applied Corporate Finance}, author={Pirrong, Craig}, year={2019}, pages={98–104} }

The payoff for a distributed configuration in terms of survivability in the cases of enemy attack directed against nodes, links or combinations of nodes and links is demonstrated. A comparison is made between diversity of assignment and perfect switching in distributed networks, and the feasibility of using low-cost unreliable communication links, even links so unreliable as to be unusable in present type networks, to form highly reliable networks is discussed. The requirements for a future all-digital data distributed network which provides common user service for a wide range of users having different requirements is considered. The use of a standard format message block permits building relatively simple switching mechanisms using an adaptive store-and-forward routing policy to handle all forms of digital data including digital voice. This network rapidly responds to changes in the network status. Recent history of measured network traffic is used to modify path selection. Simulation results are shown to indicate that highly efficient routing can be performed by local control without the necessity for any central, and therefore vulnerable, control point.}, number={1}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems}, author={Baran, P.}, year={1964}, month={Mar}, pages={1–9} }

A method is described which forces any enemy to expend an amount of work which increases as the square of the work required of the two communicants to select the key. The method provides a logically new kind of protection against the passive eavesdropper. It suggests that further research on this topic will be highly rewarding, both in a theoretical and a practical sense.}, number={4}, journal={Communications of the ACM}, author={Merkle, Ralph C.}, year={1978}, month={Apr}, pages={294–299} }

@book{Brumley_Tuveri_2011_remote_timing_ecdsa, title={Remote Timing Attacks are Still Practical}, url={https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/232}, abstractNote={For over two decades, timing attacks have been an active area of research within applied cryptography. These attacks exploit cryptosystem or protocol implementations that do not run in constant time. When implementing an elliptic curve cryptosystem with a goal to provide side-channel resistance, the scalar multiplication routine is a critical component. In such instances, one attractive method often suggested in the literature is Montgomery’s ladder that performs a fixed sequence of curve and field operations. This paper describes a timing attack vulnerability in OpenSSL’s ladder implementation for curves over binary fields. We use this vulnerability to steal the private key of a TLS server where the server authenticates with ECDSA signatures. Using the timing of the exchanged messages, the messages themselves, and the signatures, we mount a lattice attack that recovers the private key. Finally, we describe and implement an effective countermeasure.}, number={232}, author={Brumley, Billy Bob and Tuveri, Nicola}, year={2011} }

Though very easy to implement, these mechanisms are usually based on ad hoc techniques that lack a sound security analysis.We present new, simple, and practical constructions of message authentication schemes based on a cryptographic hash function. Our schemes, NMAC and HMAC, are proven to be secure as long as the underlying hash function has some reasonable cryptographic strengths. Moreover we show, in a quantitative way, that the schemes retain almost all the security of the underlying hash function. The performance of our schemes is essentially that of the underlying hash function. Moreover they use the hash function (or its compression function) as a black box, so that widely available library code or hardware can be used to implement them in a simple way, and replaceability of the underlying hash function is easily supported.}, booktitle={Advances in Cryptology — CRYPTO ’96}, publisher={Springer}, author={Bellare, Mihir and Canetti, Ran and Krawczyk, Hugo}, editor={Koblitz, Neal}, year={1996}, pages={1–15}, collection={Lecture Notes in Computer Science} }
