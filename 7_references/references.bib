The problem is to time-stamp the data, not the medium. We propose computationally practical procedures for digital time-stamping of such documents so that it is infeasible for a user either to back-date or to forward-date his document, even with the collusion of a time-stamping service. Our procedures maintain complete privacy of the documents themselves, and require no record-keeping by the time-stamping service.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Cryptology}, author={Haber, Stuart and Stornetta, W.

 @article{Nakamoto, title={Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System}, abstractNote={A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they’ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.}, author={Nakamoto, Satoshi}, pages={9} }

 @article{survey_on_all, title={A survey on efficient parallelization of blockchain-based smart contracts}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00731}, abstractNote={The main problem faced by smart contract platforms is the amount of time and computational power required to reach consensus. In a classical blockchain model, each operation is in fact performed by each node, both to update the status and to validate the results of the calculations performed by others. In this short survey we sketch some state-of-the-art approaches to obtain an eﬃcient and scalable computation of smart contracts. Particular emphasis is given to sharding, a promising method that allows parallelization and therefore a more eﬃcient management of the computational resources of the network.}, note={arXiv: 1904.00731}, journal={arXiv:1904.00731 [cs]}, author={Meneghetti, Alessio and Parise, Tommaso and Sala, Massimiliano and Taufer, Daniele}, year={2019}, month={Feb} }

Although the security provisions of Bitcoin have been thoroughly analysed, the security guarantees of variant (forked) PoW blockchains (which were instantiated with different parameters) have not received much attention in the literature. This opens the question whether existing security analysis of Bitcoin’s PoW applies to other implementations which have been instantiated with different consensus and/or network parameters. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative framework to analyse the security and performance implications of various consensus and network parameters of PoW blockchains. Based on our framework, we devise optimal adversarial strategies for double-spending and selfish mining while taking into account real world constraints such as network propagation, different block sizes, block generation intervals, information propagation mechanism, and the impact of eclipse attacks. Our framework therefore allows us to capture existing PoW-based deployments as well as PoW blockchain variants that are instantiated with different parameters, and to objectively compare the tradeoffs between their performance and security provisions.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={Gervais, Arthur and Karame, Ghassan O. and Wüst, Karl and Glykantzis, Vasileios and Ritzdorf, Hubert and Capkun, Srdjan}, year={2016}, month={Oct}, pages={3–16}, collection={CCS ’16} }

 @article{will_blockchain_be_big_deal, title={Will Blockchain Be a Big Deal? Reasons for Caution}, volume={31}, ISSN={1745-6622}, DOI={10.1111/jacf.12379}, abstractNote={The initial enthusiasm for implementing blockchain in financial markets has been dampened considerably by its collision with economic realities. Though the author warns against avoiding the Panglossian trap of viewing ours as the best of all possible worlds, he reminds us that trusted institutions have evolved and emerged in a competitive environment as a means of economizing on transaction costs. Such costs arise from the nature of transactions, including crucially the information environment in which they take place. Though new technologies such as blockchain have the potential to reduce some of these costs, they often do so without fundamentally changing the underlying economic conditions that give rise to them. And as a result, institutions such as banks and exchanges that technologists scoff at may well prove surprisingly competitive and durable in the face of technological challengers. The most successful implementation of blockchain—Bitcoin—solves a very basic transactional challenge peculiar to cryptocurrency: the double spend problem. But it does so in a very expensive way, and many other transactions pose far more complex challenges. The three cautionary tales provided by the author—the first involving securities and derivatives trading and clearing, the second commodity trading, and the third proposals to “equitize” assets—all demonstrate the need to confront “Chesterton’s Fence” when evaluating the potential of blockchain in any particular application. In other words, to understand the value of a new technology for a given set of functions, one must understand the economic forces that have shaped the processes and institutions that currently perform those functions. When such forces are considered, it often becomes apparent that new technologies like blockchain will not prove superior to existing practices—and may even create adverse unintended consequences that offset and perhaps even eliminate its beneficial effects.}, number={4}, journal={Journal of Applied Corporate Finance}, author={Pirrong, Craig}, year={2019}, pages={98–104} }
