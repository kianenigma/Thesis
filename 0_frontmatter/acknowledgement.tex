I learned all of the engineering and blockchain knowledge needed to conduct this research through
Parity Technologies, a pioneering company developing a wide variety of technologies for the
decentralized future. I joined parity with almost no experience in such fields, and find myself
extremely lucky that I was given the opportunity to learn from their engineers, make mistakes and
grow along the way. My work with Parity will continue after this thesis is over, and I hope for it
to last for many more years.

I took two courses in 2018 at UvA (even though I technically study at VU) about concurrency, both
supervised by Dr. Ana Varbanescu. Both were so enticing that they sparked my interest in concurrency
and performance engineering, eventually giving me the idea to mix it with blockchains for my final
thesis. I recall the first meeting that I had with her about my thesis, and to this day I am
grateful that she accepted and supported my work from that very first day. Looking back at it in
hindsight, \textit{I} probably wouldn't have accepted myself back then if I was in her shoe, give
that I had a very vague idea of what my main idea is, and the rather unorthodox domain of the
thesis. I can only hope to continue learning from Dr. Ana Varbanescu and enjoy it, as I always have.
