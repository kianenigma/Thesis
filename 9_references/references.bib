  abstract = {Chainspace is a decentralized infrastructure, known as a distributed ledger, that supports user defined smart contracts and executes user-supplied transactions on their objects. The correct execution of smart contract transactions is verifiable by all. The system is scalable, by sharding state and the execution of transactions, and using S-BAC, a distributed commit protocol, to guarantee consistency. Chainspace is secure against subsets of nodes trying to compromise its integrity or availability properties through Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), and extremely highauditability, non-repudiation and `blockchain' techniques. Even when BFT fails, auditing mechanisms are in place to trace malicious participants. We present the design, rationale, and details of Chainspace; we argue through evaluating an implementation of the system about its scaling and other features; we illustrate a number of privacy-friendly smart contracts for smart metering, polling and banking and measure their performance.},

  abstract = {The blockchain initially gained traction in 2008 as the technology underlying bitcoin, but now has been employed in a diverse range of applications and created a global market worth over \$150B as of 2017. What distinguishes blockchains from traditional distributed databases is the ability to operate in a decentralized setting without relying on a trusted third party. As such their core technical component is consensus: how to reach agreement among a group of nodes. This has been extensively studied already in the distributed systems community for closed systems, but its application to open blockchains has revitalized the field and led to a plethora of new designs. The inherent complexity of consensus protocols and their rapid and dramatic evolution makes it hard to contextualize the design landscape. We address this challenge by conducting a systematic and comprehensive study of blockchain consensus protocols. After first discussing key themes in classical consensus protocols, we describe: first protocols based on proof-of-work (PoW), second proof-of-X (PoX) protocols that replace PoW with more energy-efficient alternatives, and third hybrid protocols that are compositions or variations of classical consensus protocols. We develop a framework to evaluate their performance, security and design properties, and use it to systematize key themes in the protocol categories described above. This evaluation leads us to identify research gaps and challenges for the community to consider in future research endeavours.},

The payoff for a distributed configuration in terms of survivability in the cases of enemy attack directed against nodes, links or combinations of nodes and links is demonstrated. A comparison is made between diversity of assignment and perfect switching in distributed networks, and the feasibility of using low-cost unreliable communication links, even links so unreliable as to be unusable in present type networks, to form highly reliable networks is discussed. The requirements for a future all-digital data distributed network which provides common user service for a wide range of users having different requirements is considered. The use of a standard format message block permits building relatively simple switching mechanisms using an adaptive store-and-forward routing policy to handle all forms of digital data including digital voice. This network rapidly responds to changes in the network status. Recent history of measured network traffic is used to modify path selection. Simulation results are shown to indicate that highly efficient routing can be performed by local control without the necessity for any central, and therefore vulnerable, control point.},

Our schemes, NMAC and HMAC, are proven to be secure as long as the underlying hash function has some reasonable cryptographic strengths. Moreover we show, in a quantitative way, that the schemes retain almost all the security of the underlying hash function. The performance of our schemes is essentially that of the underlying hash function. Moreover they use the hash function (or its compression function) as a black box, so that widely available library code or hardware can be used to implement them in a simple way, and replaceability of the underlying hash function is easily supported.},

  abstract = {For over two decades, timing attacks have been an active area of research within applied cryptography. These attacks exploit cryptosystem or protocol implementations that do not run in constant time. When implementing an elliptic curve cryptosystem with a goal to provide side-channel resistance, the scalar multiplication routine is a critical component. In such instances, one attractive method often suggested in the literature is Montgomery's ladder that performs a fixed sequence of curve and field operations. This paper describes a timing attack vulnerability in OpenSSL's ladder implementation for curves over binary fields. We use this vulnerability to steal the private key of a TLS server where the server authenticates with ECDSA signatures. Using the timing of the exchanged messages, the messages themselves, and the signatures, we mount a lattice attack that recovers the private key. Finally, we describe and implement an effective countermeasure.},

By detecting only write-write conflicts, SI allows many memory transactions to succeed that would otherwise abort if serialized. This higher commit rate comes at the expense of introducing anomalous behaviors by allowing some real conflicting transactions to commit. We aim at improving the performance of TM systems by running programs under SI, while guaranteeing a serializable semantics. This is achieved by static analysis of TM programs using Separation Logic to detect possible anomalies when running under SI. To guarantee correct behavior, the program code can be automatically modified to avoid these anomalies. Our approach can have an important impact on the performance of single multi-core node TM systems, and also of distributed TM systems by considerable reducing the required network traffic. 1},

Although the security provisions of Bitcoin have been thoroughly analysed, the security guarantees of variant (forked) PoW blockchains (which were instantiated with different parameters) have not received much attention in the literature. This opens the question whether existing security analysis of Bitcoin's PoW applies to other implementations which have been instantiated with different consensus and/or network parameters. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative framework to analyse the security and performance implications of various consensus and network parameters of PoW blockchains. Based on our framework, we devise optimal adversarial strategies for double-spending and selfish mining while taking into account real world constraints such as network propagation, different block sizes, block generation intervals, information propagation mechanism, and the impact of eclipse attacks. Our framework therefore allows us to capture existing PoW-based deployments as well as PoW blockchain variants that are instantiated with different parameters, and to objectively compare the tradeoffs between their performance and security provisions.},

Unfortunately, there is currently no broad study of the behavior of these optimized lock algorithms on realistic applications that consider different performance metrics, such as energy efficiency and tail latency. In this article, we perform a thorough and practical analysis of synchronization, with the goal of providing software developers with enough information to design fast, scalable, and energy-efficient synchronization in their systems. First, we perform a performance study of 28 state-of-the-art mutex lock algorithms, on 40 applications, on four different multicore machines. We consider not only throughput (traditionally the main performance metric) but also energy efficiency and tail latency, which are becoming increasingly important. Second, we present an in-depth analysis in which we summarize our findings for all the studied applications. In particular, we describe nine different lock-related performance bottlenecks, and we propose six guidelines helping software developers with their choice of a lock algorithm according to the different lock properties and the application characteristics. From our detailed analysis, we make several observations regarding locking algorithms and application behaviors, several of which have not been previously discovered: (i) applications stress not only the lock\textendash unlock interface but also the full locking API (e.g., trylocks, condition variables); (ii) the memory footprint of a lock can directly affect the application performance; (iii) for many applications, the interaction between locks and scheduling is an important application performance factor; (vi) lock tail latencies may or may not affect application tail latency; (v) no single lock is systematically the best; (vi) choosing the best lock is difficult; and (vii) energy efficiency and throughput go hand in hand in the context of lock algorithms. These findings highlight that locking involves more considerations than the simple lock/unlock interface and call for further research on designing low-memory footprint adaptive locks that fully and efficiently support the full lock interface, and consider all performance metrics.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propos a new shared memory model: Transactionalmemory Coherence and Consistency (TCC).TCC providesa model in which atomic transactions are always the basicunit of parallel work, communication, memory coherence, andmemory reference consistency.TCC greatly simplifies parallelsoftware by eliminating the need for synchronization using conventionallocks and semaphores, along with their complexities.TCC hardware must combine all writes from each transaction regionin a program into a single packet and broadcast this packetto the permanent shared memory state atomically as a large block.This simplifies the coherence hardware because it reduces theneed for small, low-latency messages and completely eliminatesthe need for conventional snoopy cache coherence protocols, asmultiple speculatively written versions of a cache line may safelycoexist within the system.Meanwhile, automatic, hardware-controlledrollback of speculative transactions resolves any correctnessviolations that may occur when several processors attemptto read and write the same data simultaneously.The cost of thissimplified scheme is higher interprocessor bandwidth.To explore the costs and benefits of TCC, we study the characterisitcsof an optimal transaction-based memory system, and examinehow different design parameters could affect the performanceof real systems.Across a spectrum of applications, the TCC modelitself did not limit available parallelism.Most applications areeasily divided into transactions requiring only small write buffers,on the order of 4-8 KB.The broadcast requirements of TCCare high, but are well within the capabilities of CMPs and small-scaleSMPs with high-speed interconnects.},

Although original gossip algorithm can be devoted to data synchronization in semi-distributed blockchain network, it can not be well applied to actual network environment. Since the probability of selecting a target node during data synchronization is fixed, it is inevitable that a message can be sent to a duplicate node. It will not only cause a lot of redundant messages, but also bring inefficient data synchronization. To address this problem, this paper proposes an improved HNA-Gossip algorithm which can reduce the probability of selecting duplicate nodes to send messages by recording historical node information dynamically. The simulation results show that, compared with the original gossip algorithm, various aspects of HNA-Gossip algorithm perform better.},

If one process is interrupted in the middle of an operation, other processes will not be prevented from operating on that object. In highly concurrent systems, lock-free data structures avoid common problems associated with conventional locking techniques, including priority inversion, convoying, and difficulty of avoiding deadlock. This paper introduces transactional memory, a new multiprocessor architecture intended to make lock-free synchronization as efficient (and easy to use) as conventional techniques based on mutual exclusion. Transactional memory allows programmers to define customized read-modify-write operations that apply to multiple, independently-chosen words of memory. It is implemented by straightforward extensions to any multiprocessor cache-coherence protocol. Simulation results show that transactional memory matches or outperforms the best known locking techniques for simple benchmarks, even in the absence of priority inversion, convoying, and deadlock.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

Though the author warns against avoiding the Panglossian trap of viewing ours as the best of all possible worlds, he reminds us that trusted institutions have evolved and emerged in a competitive environment as a means of economizing on transaction costs. Such costs arise from the nature of transactions, including crucially the information environment in which they take place. Though new technologies such as blockchain have the potential to reduce some of these costs, they often do so without fundamentally changing the underlying economic conditions that give rise to them. And as a result, institutions such as banks and exchanges that technologists scoff at may well prove surprisingly competitive and durable in the face of technological challengers. The most successful implementation of blockchain\textemdash Bitcoin\textemdash solves a very basic transactional challenge peculiar to cryptocurrency: the double spend problem. But it does so in a very expensive way, and many other transactions pose far more complex challenges. The three cautionary tales provided by the author\textemdash the first involving securities and derivatives trading and clearing, the second commodity trading, and the third proposals to ``equitize'' assets\textemdash all demonstrate the need to confront ``Chesterton's Fence'' when evaluating the potential of blockchain in any particular application. In other words, to understand the value of a new technology for a given set of functions, one must understand the economic forces that have shaped the processes and institutions that currently perform those functions. When such forces are considered, it often becomes apparent that new technologies like blockchain will not prove superior to existing practices\textemdash and may even create adverse unintended consequences that offset and perhaps even eliminate its beneficial effects.},

  abstract = {A growing body of research on Bitcoin and other permissionless cryptocurrencies that utilize Nakamoto's blockchain has shown that they do not easily scale to process a high throughput of transactions, or to quickly approve individual transactions; blocks must be kept small, and their creation rates must be kept low in order to allow nodes to reach consensus securely. As of today, Bitcoin processes a mere 3-7 transactions per second, and transaction confirmation takes at least several minutes. We present SPECTRE, a new protocol for the consensus core of cryptocurrencies that remains secure even under high throughput and fast confirmation times. At any throughput, SPECTRE is resilient to attackers with up to 50\textbackslash\% of the computational power (up until the limit defined by network congestion and bandwidth constraints). SPECTRE can operate at high block creation rates, which implies that its transactions confirm in mere seconds (limited mostly by the round-trip-time in the network). Key to SPECTRE's achievements is the fact that it satisfies weaker properties than classic consensus requires. In the conventional paradigm, the order between any two transactions must be decided and agreed upon by all non-corrupt nodes. In contrast, SPECTRE only satisfies this with respect to transactions performed by honest users. We observe that in the context of money, two conflicting payments that are published concurrently could only have been created by a dishonest user, hence we can afford to delay the acceptance of such transactions without harming the usability of the system. Our framework formalizes this weaker set of requirements for a cryptocurrency's distributed ledger. We then provide a formal proof that SPECTRE satisfies these requirements.},

In this paper, we analyze the performance of Go, and compare it with Java from two aspects: compile time and concurrency. There are many studies about the performance analysis and comparison of programming languages, but only a few publications investigate Go. Some of Go performance evaluation are based on the experimental release of Go. To analyze concurrency features, we implement simple matrix multiplication programs in both Go and Java. Java implementation uses Java Thread, and Go implementation uses Gor-outine and Channel. From the experiment, Go derived better performance than Java in both compile time and concurrency. Moreover, Go code shows the ease of concurrent programming. Go is still young, but we are convinced that Go will become the mainstream.},

  abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities and industries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this paper, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of decentralized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review of the strategy adopted for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of blockchain networks in a broad area of telecommunication. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.},

At the heart of the argument that this enables programmers to build more reliable and efficient software is the borrow checker - a novel approach to ownership that aims to balance type system expressivity with usability. And yet, to date there is no core type system that captures Rust's notion of ownership and borrowing, and hence no foundation for research on Rust to build upon. In this work, we set out to capture the essence of this model of ownership by developing a type systems account of Rust's borrow checker. We present Oxide, a formalized programming language close to source-level Rust (but with fully-annotated types). This presentation takes a new view of lifetimes as an approximation of the provenances of references, and our type system is able to automatically compute this information through a substructural typing judgment. We provide the first syntactic proof of type safety for borrow checking using progress and preservation. Oxide is a simpler formulation of borrow checking - including recent features such as non-lexical lifetimes - that we hope researchers will be able to use as the basis for work on Rust.},

The consensus protocols currently used in most blockchain systems can be broadly divided into two categories: the probabilistic-finality consensus protocols and the absolute-finality consensus protocols. This paper introduces some of the main consensus protocols of these two categories, and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses as well as the applicable blockchain types.},
